## Architectural Pattern

The authentication module adheres to a modular architecture, specifically implementing the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern. This choice ensures clean code organization, maintainability, and scalability for the entire platform.

## Frameworks

The authentication module leverages the following frameworks:

- **SnapKit:** A concise Auto Layout DSL to simplify the layout code.
- **NetworkService:** Facilitates communication with the server.
- **JSON:** Handles JSON parsing for data interchange.
- **URL Session:** Manages HTTP requests for API communication.
- **HTTP Requests:** Executes various HTTP requests to interact with the server.

## How to Use

Navigate through the authentication module with ease using the following steps:

### Login
- Input your username and password.
- Click "Login" to authenticate.
- New users can conveniently register through the provided registration link.

### Registration
- Provide your email, username, and password.
- Ensure your password complies with the specified requisites.
- Click "Register" to create a new account.

### Successful Login
- Upon successful login, access the main application screen.
- Click "Logout" to securely log out, triggering a confirmation modal.

## How to Install

Installation is straightforward:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open the project in your preferred iOS development environment (preferably Xcode).
- Build and run the application on your Apple device or simulator.

## Lessons Learned

Insights gained during the development process:

- **Architectural Pattern:** Implementing the MVVM pattern improved code organization and maintainability.
- **User Interface:** Designing without Storyboard enhanced proficiency in programmatic UI development.
- **Layout:** Integration of SnapKit simplified Auto Layout constraints, improving dynamic layout.
- **Network Communication:** Efficient use of NetworkService, URL Session, and HTTP Requests for seamless API interaction.

These lessons contribute to my ongoing growth and development as a software engineer.
